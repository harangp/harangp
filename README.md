Hi, I'm Peter Harang, I design and build complex, heavily integrated IT ecosystems for the banking sector.

On my spare time, I fiddle around with new technologies, and try to build a stable ecosystem with them. You can chek it out at https://credetra.com/en

Currently I'm into machine learning, Tensorflow.JS, TypeScript kind of stuff.
